A regular expression (sometimes called a rational expression)
is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern,
mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching,
i.e. find and replace-like operations.(Wikipedia). Regular expressions
are a generalized way to match patterns with sequences of characters.
It is used in every programming language like C++, Java and Python.
